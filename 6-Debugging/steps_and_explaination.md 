# I also need to create one langgraph.json file because it is the requirement of LangSmith


# langgraph.json
# {
#   "dependencies":["."], # Where dot refers to the current directory.
#  All that are in my current directry that are all my dependency files 
#   "graphs":{ # It asks for a key related to graphs where my graph is basically there?
#  Here we need to mention all that file names that are imp for the graph  
#     "openai_agent":"./openai_agent.py:agent" #This agent is defined in opennai._agent.py
#   },
#   "env":"../.env"
# Double dot means go to the parent directory and this dot env is my dependencies
# }

# The best part is that when i write the command. It will just going to pickup all 
# the information from that particular dependencies and it is going to execute.


# for langgraph studio i need to  use very imp library => langgraph-cli[inmem] -> This will
#  actually create my api


# Now inorder to run this i will open my terminal and move to
#  6-Debugging where we have openai_agent.py file 

# and write in terminal => langgraph dev

# To end this you need to press control c in terminal
